      <description>In the previous post that covered chapter 5 of Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir, I ported most of the code from the book with very few modifications. Code in this post that covers chapter 6: Properties-Driven Development are not straight ports. All the code done [so far] are hosted at https://github.com/shaolang/pbtic I&amp;rsquo;m using test.check as the property-based testing tool in Clojure.
In this chapter (of the book), it tackles the Back to the Checkout code kata: calculate the total price of the items scanned at the checkout and handle specials correctly.</description>

      <description>Reading Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir and following along the examples helped me in learning this exciting testing methodology; but it also left me wondering: have I really absorbed and internalized just by following along?
So, I reached out to Fred, got his approval, and started translating the code from Erlang/Elixir to Clojure with test.check. All the code done [so far] are hosted at https://github.com/shaolang/pbtic I&amp;rsquo;m using test.check as the property-based testing tool in Clojure.</description>
